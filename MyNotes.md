# Rochelle's Project Notes

## This documents my thoughts and plans for the Galactic Age Calculator 

---
* got started from cloning working project from my repo, npm install then npm run start
* but i had a problem :(
* took a long time setting up. I got fixated on npm run start not working
     + it builds but gives error of build scrit not found
     + decided best to forget this issue for now, needed to move on!


* I will use life expectancy of 88 years. 
    + Maybe i go back and make a more complex formula but for now i will use a constant 

* styling not a priority but i did want some basic UI

* Want to rename calculateGalacticAge()
     * it's a setter so name setGalacticAge()
     * will change after done with functionality

* keep date
     + maybe add birthday things
